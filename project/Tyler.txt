	Concept
==========

- New York, New York Casino:

	+ From the outside, it's easy to see the door to get in
	
	+ Once you're inside, it's hard to find your way out

- If you go to tyedart.com or littlelds.com from tyharmon.com, it should be "hard" to find your way back to tyharmon.com


==========
	Ideas
==========

- The background logo should periodically rotate (between the 6)

- Four customer logos visible at all times

- If you click a logo, it fills the entire four-logo area

- When you scroll to the bottom, no extra spaces at the bottom

- The logos should be clickable, unless they result in a dead link (use HTTP requests to check)

- Custom blog (instead of using a third-party ... maybe)

- Github will be used for source control

- Try to start by thinking of the domain model and how it will be represented
